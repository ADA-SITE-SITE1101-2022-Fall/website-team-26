            <p>I am Seljan Mamedova . I am 18 years old and I currently study at ADA University. My faculty is BSCE.To be honest, I had never thought about being computer engineering student because I wanted to be a pilot. However, one day I was diagnosed poor eyesight, for that reason I could not apply to Aviation Academy. After that situation, I worried about my future; therefore, I searched  alternative career path. Finally, I realized that computer engineering is in demand nowadays.To sum up, I was admitted to bachelor program in computer engineering at ADA university. Although I face trouble in my academic life, I have strong persistence and I believce that I will overcome this challenge. ðŸ’ª</p>

        Next, we taught coding using activities on code.org. At the end we handed out certificates.<br> Our students did not have difficulty following the lesson 
        and easily grasped programming concepts covered during the class. 
        Upon finishing the lesson, they seemed interested in continuing learning with code.org.
